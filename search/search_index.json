For example, this saved screenshot of an isosurface from the CT-scan dataset shows no shadows, and only uses a single light source:</p> <p></p> <p>Such a rendering lacks clues that you as a viewer normally uses to understand shapes and spatial relations. Here is the same image with added shadows:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can hopefully see, such a rendering provides much more information. For example, the parts seen through the right eye are now clearly seen to be located quite far backwards, something that was hard to judge in the non-shadowed image, and you can judge how much overhang there is from the cheekbone.</p> <p>To enable such shadowed rendering we used the Raytracing modes in ParaView. These use more advanced rendering and lighting techniques to produce more realistic renderings. To enable this for the whole scene, select a filter and check <code>Enable Ray Tracing</code> under the Ray Traced Rendering property block (all the way at the bottom), and then check <code>Shadows</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>This will change the rendering mode and show shadows on objects, just like the image above.</p> <p>Slow interaction with ray tracing modes</p> <p>Note that rendering and interaction can become quite a bit slower when enabling ray tracing. This has an influence on the whole user interface, and might make it almost unusable. So be somewhat careful in tweaking the ray tracing parameters, such as <code>Samples Per Pixel</code>, to high values. </p> <p>In some cases it might be more effective to only use ray tracing mode when generating images from a Python script.</p> <p>In this particular case we used the <code>OSPRay raycaster</code>, which is a CPU-based rendering mode with a fairly simple lighting model. Rendering and interaction speed will depend on the number of CPU cores in your system.</p>"},{"location":"appearance/#path-tracing","title":"Path tracing","text":"<p>A more advanced rendering method is Path tracing, which simulates more realistic lighting effects, such as light bouncing between surfaces reaching otherwise dark areas. Shadowing is by definition a part of the lighting when using path tracing, so the <code>Shadows</code> checkbox is greyed out.</p> <p>There's two path tracer modes in Paraview, the OSPray path tracer and the OptiX path tracer. The former (OSPray), is always available and is CPU-based, while the latter (OptiX) is GPU-based and only available if your system has an NVIDIA GPU. So the latter is to be preferred if you can enable it, as it will lead to less interaction slowdown. The resulting images will differ somewhat in lighting between these rendering modes, by the way.</p> <p>With pathtracer rendering the main setting to tweak is <code>Samples Per Pixel</code>. The higher you set this the less noisy and better the rendered image becomes (but remember the warning from above about slow interaction).

The transfer function is used to control the appearance, in terms of color and opacity, of a volume. Simply speaking it maps a voxel data value to a (color, opacity) pair. By doing this for all voxels and compositing the visual result back-to-front an image is generated. It is a really powerful technique for visualizing volumetric data, but it can be a bit challenging to get good results.</p> <p>The default transfer function in ParaView is linear, mapping the data range minimum value to fully transparent blue, and the data range maximum value to fully opaque red. See the graph representation and color bar in the Color Map Editor (<code>View &gt; Color Map Editor</code>):</p> <p></p> <p>This default gives a fairly good overview of what's in the full dataset value range. But, for example, the values corresponding to the skull, which we know from the contour used earlier is around 2000, are mostly hidden by many layers of voxels containing the skin. We can just barely see a bit of the skull near the right eye show through.</p> <p>We can try to show the bone more clearly by making the values 2000 opaque, and lowering the opacity of the existing points. By clicking in the graph we add a point, while dragging points allows control over both associated value (X) as well as opacity (Y):</p> <p></p> <p>Unforunately, this hasn't helped much, although the rendering is slightly different. We're still seeing too much of the low values (blue). Let's add another point to bring down the low value range to complete transparency:</p> <p></p> <p>Now we're getting somewhere, it nicely shows the skull (and other higher-valued parts, like the vertebrae and teeth). The skull is shown almost fully white, though, with no good way to grasp its shape (similar to lack of shadows showed earlier). This is due to the simple rendering used by default for volume rendering: it only composites mapped voxel colors onto each other, there's no advanced lighting being applied. Luckily, there's a setting to improve this. We can enable <code>Shade</code> in the Volume Rendering section:</p> <p></p> <p>We can further tweak the colors of the different values in the transfer function, by clicking on a point in the color bar, pressing <code>Enter</code> and picking a more bone-like color:</p> <p></p> <p>By tweaking the transfer function a bit more we can get a nice view of the bone parts, in the context of the skin, and even highlighting the teeth a bit in white:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see there's a quite lot that can be achieved by editing the transfer function. In this case we used a one-dimensional function, mapping data value to color + opacity. Recent versions of ParaView have added the ability to use a two-dimensional transfer function, which has data value and associated gradient value as input.

How to start ParaView depends on where you installed the binaries after downloading them.</p> <p>\u25b6 Once ParaView has opened, you have to load the first data file.

To do this, we want to use the stream-tracer filter. With this filter we simulate injecting particles in our flow field at specific locations. By letting these particles follow the flow, based on the velocity vectors in the grid, and tracing them over time we get an impression of the fluid flow through the model. </p> <p>The stream-tracer filter is based on tracing a virtual particle through the cells of a dataset, i.e. regions of model space defined using 3D points. The flow direction within a cell, as indicated by the velocity vector value, is then integrated by the filter to determine a particle's position over time, thereby creating a trace of the particle through the dataset. </p> <p>But as noted above, there's currently only a single cell in our dataset holding all the points, which provides no meaningful way to trace particles. So we need to divide up the dataset domain into small cells. Furthermore, the flow vector values are currently associated only with the points of the dataset, while we need those values for each cell for the stream-tracer to work.</p> <p>We can fix these two issues by applying a 3D Delaunay triangulation. This creates cells from the dataset based on the existing points. The cells created are small and detailed enough so that our Stream Tracer filter can reasonably work.

Sometimes, during 3D interaction with the view you might accidentally change a widget, such as the sphere here (there's more widgets, for example to set the location of a clip plane), which changes filter parameters. In case you did not want this to happen you can reset a filter back to the values it used since the last Apply by using the Reset button at the top of the Properties panel.</p> <p>In most cases a widget can be hidden using a filter option, which prevents further interaction with it. Hiding the sphere here can be done by disabling the Show Sphere option under Point Cloud Parameters.</p> <p>\u25b6 To make the streamlines more visually appealing, we add another filter on the output of the StreamTracer filter, namely a Tube filter (Filters \u2192 Alphabetical \u2192 Tube).

There is currently quite a large number of glyphs, and perhaps still too many to be effective. This doesn't help in the overall visual interpretation of the data, but we do need to balance getting enough coverage of the full dataset.</p> <p>\u25b6 The filter settings under Masking provide different modes options for the number and distribution of the glyphs placed. For example, see what happens when using Glyph Mode <code>Every Nth point</code> when you show a glyph for every 10th or 11th point. Or use 500 glyphs uniformly distributed (and why that means you need choose these kinds of parameters with care).</p> <p>\u25b6 A useful variant is to apply glyphs to the output of the Stream Trace filter (by creating a second Glyph filter). This is possible because the generated streamlines are themselves polygonal data, where each streamline consists of a Poly-Line cell that uses a set of 3D points. As a Glyph filter uses point positions to place glyphs we can place them for each streamline. Experiment with this, using different types of glyphs, like Sphere and Arrow.

To do this, we will add a camera path that orbits around the coral as it animates.</p> <p>\u25b6 The coral grows in the -Y direction, which you can verify by looking at the small 3D axes in the lower-left of the 3D view. This is unfortunate, as by default the data is shown upside-down. We will set up a good view using the toolbar buttons for viewing directly along one of the coordinate axes. Press the +Z button to look along the +Z direction, with +Y up, then press the +90 button twice to rotate the view to -Y up.</p> <p></p> <p>\u25b6 Verify that the animation playback now shows the coral nicely growing upwards, with the data ground plane horizontal. </p> <p>Next, we will add a circular camera motion, a so-called orbit.</p> <p>\u25b6 In the Time Manager in the Animations row select Camera from the left-most drop-down box, and Follow Path in the dropdown right to it.

The Center value is the point around which the camera is rotated, Normal is the vector used for the rotation and the Origin is the initial camera position. Set the Normal value to be -Y up (0, -1, 0), or else the might be some weird rotation during the orbit. Normally, you will need to experiment in your own scenes to figure out correct values, but use the ones given below and press Ok.</p> <p></p> <p>\u25b6 Press Ok in the Animation Keyframes dialog to apply the new values.

Use File \u2192 Save Animation for this. You can either save to a sequence of images, or directly to a video file, such as a .avi or .ogv. In this case it's best to set the Frame Rate value to something like 20 (leading to a 5 second animation, as we have 100 frames).</p>"},{"location":"miscellaneous/","title":"Miscellaneous","text":""},{"location":"miscellaneous/#official-resources","title":"Official resources","text":"<p>The official ParaView User Guide is quite good and contain lots of detailed information on data analysis and visualization with ParaView.

A Programmable Filter is a pipeline filter in all respects. It takes an input dataset and produces an output dataset of a chosen type. It can compute any function that you can write in Python (including use of packages). There's special support for making NumPy usage easier with Paraview (and VTK) data types.</p> <p>Let's say we wanted to create a filter that normalizes a dataset using the minimum and maximum value ranges. Below is Python code for such a programmable filter, applied to a dataset having point data array \"RTData\":</p> <pre><code>data_in = inputs[0].PointData[\"RTData\"]\nminval = numpy.min(data_in)\nmaxval = numpy.max(data_in)\n\ndata_out = (data_in - minval) / (maxval - minval)\noutput.PointData.append(data_out, \"Normalized\")\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, the upstream filter whose data we are processing is a Wavelet source. The <code>inputs</code> array contains all input ports of the programmable filter, of which there is just one here, which is receiving data from the upstream wavelet source. On that input port we retrieve the point data array named \"RTData\" (which a wavelet value for each 3D point). We compute min and max values and normalize the input array in one go, thanks to NumPy, and then set that as the point data output array called \"Normalized\".</p> <p>Here's the GUI showing the pipeline, the code set on the programmable filter, as well as isosurfaces halfway in the data range, for the original wavelet dataset (left), and the normalized one (right). Note the different color map ranges.</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, it is quite easy to write a custom filter. As long as you can express whatever operation you need in Python. And for large datasets the operation needs to be efficient to execute, unless you don't mind waiting a bit.</p> <p>However, in this example the output data was a simple 3D array, containing per-point values, so that made the operation easy to express. But when you want to produce more exotic data types, such as 3D geometry, you will need to create data that adheres to the ParaView/VTK data model.</p> <p>Editing the filter code can also be a bit cumbersome. The code area does not show a lot of lines, so you might need to scroll for longer scripts. With the  button you can open the Script Editor window in linked mode: any changes you make in the editor window will be applied to the filter code, and vice versa.
