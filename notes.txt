-> add help ? tip
-> volume rendering TF editor in exercise?



can have multiple layouts in UI

line chart view, with Plot Data filter, can even do scatter plots



 



vtkm filters

no speedup? but massive slowdown?

streamlinesrepresentation

https://discourse.paraview.org/t/streamline-representation-not-working/9222
need to recreate renderview after loading plugin, to get streamlines repr in list
wervel state, select delaunay3d, switch to streamlines repr. can tweak streamlines params


pvNVIDIAIndeX (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/index-paraview-plugin/), is stil being developed?
asks to agree to EULA when loaded in paraview. non-commercial use only!
since 5.12 comes with a test license for multi-GPU use, which experires after some time
CUDA12 since 5.12, needs CUDA CC 5.0 or higher
recreate view (or add layout), then pick NVIDIA IndeX representation
lighting tweaks, isosurface, slice

ospray


node editor plugin, verbosity option



mention blender courses

https://www.kitware.com/paraview-python-view-is-now-more-versatile/
new func signature, should return vtkImageData
python_view support for matplotlib

pressing window button in Script area brings up Script Editor in "linked" mode: edits
in the editor will also appear in the Script area

Script > Load script into current tab

Fix output messages window in place, instead of as a popup
Any way to force python view to replot?

Errors also go to console window (Linux)

Python 3.10

Easy to crash, doesn't correctly update parsed Python code?
No undo in Script area!
Indenting doesn't always work in Script Editor
Stack traces in the output window are not indented correctly

Can only have a single PythonView?
