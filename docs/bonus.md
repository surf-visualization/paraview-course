# Bonus Exercise - A stationary fluid mixer

You should now have gained enough ParaView skills in order to re-create the visualization on the [Home](../) page of these course notes. The visualization shows a so-called static (or stationary) mixer. In such a mixer two fluids enter separated on one side and exit mixed on the other side. The basis for the visualization is the data file __SMRX.vtk__.

Good luck!
